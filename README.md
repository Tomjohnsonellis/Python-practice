# Python-practice
Similar to my R-practice repo, a place to record various python tasks.
The book I'm using for work in the python-crash-course folder is: 
["Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e)

(I'm actually using the first edition, but I'd imagine they are pretty similar)
